# Processor single-cycle in VHDL

A project which aims at simulating the behavior of a single-cycle processor in VHDL

## src
Source files for the processor

### UAL
Aritmetic and logical unit

### BancReg
Read and write in memory registers

### Decodeur
Read the MIPS code and execute it

## simu
Source files to simulate the processor with each element
